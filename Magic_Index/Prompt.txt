Magic Index:
	A magic index in an array A[0...n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted
	array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.

	What if the values are not distinct?
Hints:
	#170: Start with a brute force algorithm.
	#204: Your brute force algorithm probably ran in O(N) time. If you're trying to beat that runtime,
	what runtime do you think you will get to? What sorts of algorithms have that runtime?
	#240: Can you solve this in O(log N)?
	#286: Can you apply binary search to the problem?
	#340: Given a specific index and value, can you identify if the magic index would be before or
	after it?
