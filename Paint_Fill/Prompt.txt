Paint Fill:
	Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing programs. That is,
	given a screen (represented by a two-diminensional array of colors), a point, and a new color,
	fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.
Hints:
	#364: Think about this as a graph.
	#382: You can implement this using depth-first (or breadth-first). Each adjacent pixel of the "right
	color" is a connected edge.
