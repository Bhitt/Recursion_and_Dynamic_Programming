Coins:
	Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and
	pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents.
Hints:
	#300: Try breaking it down into subproblems. If you were making change, what is the first choice
	you would make?
	#324: You might first choose how many quarters to use.
	#343: Once you've decided to use 2 quarters to make change for 98 cents, you now need to figure 
	out how to make change for 48 cents using the other coins.
	#380: Is there any repeated work in your algorithm?
	#394: Try using memoization.
